### What it is for

This library is for debouncing and reading momentary contact switches like tactile buttons. 
It uses callbacks to trigger actions when a Button is pressed once or held for a given duration. 
It also provides a sequence counter to be able to rise an event when a given pattern of presses has been matched.
